The sun comes up again but brings no warmth. The cold has taken over me. I use my last remaining strength to bring out the stored firewood. The irony of finding food long after my hunger has left me. It stirs something, hope. Once the fire gets going, the world becomes a little more real. As strength returns I put on a pot on the fire and start brewing some stew.
I am back to my drinking, when a stranger appears. A man not much older than Julius. Slouched under a rucksack, axe in hand. He loosens his grip and hangs the axe to his side. He drops the rucksack with a thud and stands close to the fire. His eyes may have left me but he is aware of my every move.
