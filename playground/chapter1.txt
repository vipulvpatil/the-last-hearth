// This has gotten a little mechanical and all the weight built in the prelude seems lost. I need to write the entire scene before building the branching.

The Golden Ale keg is empty. I slowly make my way to store room, pausing to glance at the salted frozen meat.

* [I should eat] -> cook
* [I am not done drinking] -> drink

===drink===
Ignoring the meat, I begin tapping another keg.
The work is tiring and the tavern feels colder than before.
* [Start a fire] -> fire
* [Continue drinking in the cold] -> no_fire


===cook===
I get the fire going and prepare a stew. 
-> encounter

===fire===
I grab some stored firewood and eventually get a fire going. I return to the Golden Liquid. 
-> encounter

===no_fire===
I use the Golden Liquid to drown the cold. 
-> encounter

===encounter===
{fire: ->Rivalgo | {~->Atreis|->Silvasa}}

===Rivalgo===
A man not much older than Julian makes his presence known with a polite cough. Slouched under a rucksack he makes his way to the bar. Placing a few coppers on the counter he whispers "Ale and something to eat".
* [Feed the man] I bring him Golden Liquid with a bowl full of stew.
* (ask) [Ask about him] "What brings you this far South"? I would be happy to answer your questions once I have eaten something.

- The man quickly gulps the stew and walks over to me with his Ale. {ask:"So you wanted to know what I am doing here?"}
"Name's Rivalgo. From Westbend. On my way to Greyfort." He takes the final gulp and leaves the mug on the counter. "You haven't seen a young girl pass by?"
* [Lie] "I might have, people pass through." He looks around the unkempt tavern. He sighs. "Look! I am not trying to hurt her, just trying to bring her home. She is my sister. Now I ask again, have you seen her?"
* [Truth]

- "No! But I haven't been here long". Dejected he holds his mug.
* [Pour him another mug] He takes a sip. "With Ma and Pa gone, it is hard enough. And now she runs off." -> investigate
* [Let him be] You leave him alone with his thoughts.
He slowly pull his rucksack onto his back and leaves.
-> END

Atreis arrives
