I close the door with my back at it. The knee buckles. Barely holds me. I instinctively wriggle my fingers. The bear took a piece of my arm but most of me has made it here. Here to the...
The Last Hearth

As I take the hood down and wipe off the flakes of snow from my face, a fully lit tavern appears.
Laughter from a table is drowned by an argument on another. A roar of Huzzah accompanies raised goblets around the fireplace. Is that him? I take a small step towards him. He begins to flicker away. I reach out and grasp nothing. Silence calls his name. 

Julian.

I read the letter in my trembling hand again.
“Nothing like sitting by the fire after a trek to the Untamed Lands. Only thing warmer is your onion soup. You got to make that when I am back”.
The leg hurts again as I stumble back. I push past the dead embers in the fireplace.

I drag myself to a stool behind the bar counter. Kegs of ale marked “Golden Liquid” linger under the bar. "Smooth, hits like a brick though. I will bring you a bottle. And no, I am not just drowning my life in alcohol. Can you not?"
I try the Golden Liquid. Another swig. Another page.

“They have found a new kind of mud. It should help with the leaky roof. I will bring some."
The letter slips from my hand, settles on the counter. I expect to see it littered with tears. Instead the tears are on my cheek. Frozen.

The goblet is too slow. I take the bottle and read again.
“Dear Mama,…”

An abrupt sound brings me out of my stupor. A silhouette stands in the open door. The door pounds to a close as does my heart. The stranger slowly starts walking towards me while unravelling the garb hiding their face. A faint metal clinging accompanies him. It is intentional. 
He reaches the counter and continues to gaze upon me. Two doors in the room, a locked one behind me and the other behind him. His fingers twitch as he notices the same.
I hear a hissed voice. "A drink for the thirsty". The lips never move. As I grab a goblet from under the counter, I notice the fingers move again. 
He finish his drink, but one eye always on me. As the left hand keeps the drink down, the right fingers twitch one last time. I close my eyes.
The clinking again and then the thud of the door. A pair of coins glint on the counter. Cold, unmoving, as empty as the Hearth.
