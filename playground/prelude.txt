I close the door with my back at it. Slowly, I slump to the floor. I made it… barely. The last few weeks blur past my closed eyes. A pain shoots down my leg, reminding me of the bear attack. I instinctively bend my fingers confirming most of me has made it here. Here to the...
The Last Hearth

As I take the hood down and wipe off the flakes of snow from my face, a darkness fades mildly revealing a dimly lit tavern. 
[An image of the tavern fully lit with a few patrons]
Long tables in the middle and a few smaller ones along the windows. All occupied. Large bar at the far end tended by two men. And a fireplace on the West wall. A picture of a woman on the mantle. Wait! There is no picture! There is nothing here! Just an emptiness.

This is how he had described it. I take out the letter from my pocket and start reading it again
“A picture of the woman twice as pretty as Marie and you know how pretty Marie is. Some say she was the daughter of the original owner of the Hearth. I believe them”.
[An image of the tavern dark and broken]
I clear my mind and take another look around. The windows are boarded up, letting in little light while keeping out the storm. Only two long tables remain. Dusty but whole.

This is no longer the place Julian mentions.
“The fireplace is where the heroes are. The last one I met was a knight who had fought a hydra in the South. Imagine seeing a hydra, let alone fighting it.”
The temperature drops. I check the windows. The boards are holding. But the cold continues to spread. I hold the bar counter. Slowly settling on the nearest stool behind the bar counter. One hand grasps the letter tightly, the other the bar counter. Neither able to let go.
I notice some kegs of ale marked “Golden Liquid” hidden under the bar. Left behind. Same as me.

“I am in the Rangers Guild now. We are going South to the Untamed Lands to explore the nearby ruins.I don't want to be a traveling merchant all my life. It is time your lad earns some glory.”
The storm has grown tired and starts to die down. I notice the letter has slipped my hand and settled on the counter. I expect to see it littered with tears. Instead I find the tears frozen on my cheek.

I pour myself a glass of Golden Liquid and start reading the letter again
“Dear Mama,…”
An abrupt sound brings me out of my stupor. A silhouette stands in the open door. The door pounds to a close as does my heart. The stranger slowly starts walking towards me while unravelling the garb hiding their face. A faint metal clinging accompanies him. It is intentional. 
He reaches the counter and continues to gaze upon me. Two doors in the room, a locked one behind me and the other behind him. His fingers twitch as he notices the same.
I hear a hissed voice. "A drink for the thirsty". The lips never move. As I grab a goblet from under the counter, I notice the fingers move again. 
He finish his drink, but one eye always on me. As the left hand keeps the drink down, the right fingers twitch one last time. I close my eyes.
The clinking again and then the thud of the door. A pair of coins glint on the counter. Cold, unmoving, as empty as the Hearth.



--> Review

This draft is already tighter than your first one—you’ve cut some of the clutter and that helps. But it’s still carrying dead weight and the pacing doesn’t quite land. Here’s the blunt breakdown:

What’s better now

The setup with the door, exhaustion, and injury is cleaner. You cut the “salve/arm” detail, which was unnecessary before.

The tavern reveal is sharper—the “lit vs broken” contrast works better when it’s simpler.

Julian’s letter is less bloated. “I don’t want to be a traveling merchant all my life” is clearer and more personal than the older version.

The stranger’s arrival has more economy now. Removing the “life-ending blow never delivered” line helps.

What’s still dragging

Overexplaining the cold: “The temperature drops. I check the windows. The boards are holding. But the cold continues to spread.” You don’t need all of that. Pick one image and let it sting. Right now it’s like you’re narrating stage directions.

Letter excerpts still too generic: “Imagine seeing a hydra” and “It is time your lad earns some glory” both feel like placeholders from a fantasy stockpile. They don’t tell me who Julian is. Is he naïve? Brash? Yearning? Right now he reads as “generic hopeful boy.”

The bar counter moment: “One hand grasps the letter tightly, the other the bar counter. Neither able to let go.” That’s reaching for drama but comes off forced. If you keep it, make it sharper—right now it feels like filler description trying to inflate tension.

The stranger: Still drags. Too many beats: his walk, his twitching fingers, the exits, the hissed voice, the goblet, the twitch again. You’re repeating tension without escalation. The encounter should either build (each beat more threatening) or cut clean. As it stands, it plateaus.

Clichés creeping back: “Storm has grown tired,” “door pounds to a close as does my heart,” “coins glint… cold, unmoving.” These are weakening your atmosphere.

Verdict: This is a leaner draft but it’s not yet sharp. The core beats are good—arrival, ruined tavern, letter contrast, strange visitor—but you’re still padding them with repetitive description and stock phrases. You need to decide if this prelude is about grief, memory vs. reality, or survival dread. Right now, it’s trying to do all three, and the weight is spread too thin.

Do you want me to push you on Julian’s letter voice (because that’s the weakest element left), or on the stranger scene’s tension structure (because that’s your big dramatic payoff)?
