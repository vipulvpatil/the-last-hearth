I close the door with my back at it. Slowly, I slump to the floor. I made it… barely. The last few weeks blur past my closed eyes. Some of it real, some imagined, all of it nightmarish. Was there a bear? I drown the image, and use the last bit of my energy to pull myself up again. A pain shoots down my right leg. There was a fall many days ago, but I had expected it to heal before I reached my destination. Now I was here, and so was the pain. This was my destination. There was no mistaking the name I found engraved on the creaky snow covered board outside.
The Last Hearth.
As I take the hood down and wipe off the flakes of snow from my face, a darkness fades mildly revealing a dimly lit tavern. Four long tables in the middle. Six small ones along the East Wall next to the three windows that never open. Enough chairs, stools and benches to match each one of them. Large bar at the South end. And a fireplace on the West wall. A picture of a woman on the mantle. No! There is no picture! Just an emptiness on the wall.
This is how he had described it. I take out the letter from my pocket and start reading it again
“A picture of the prettiest woman I have ever seen. Some say she was the daughter of the original owner of the Hearth. Others claim she was the wife of the Lord who built this place. No one knows for sure”.
Julian was always too quick to believe, too trusting of others. If I had a sickle for every time Amelia used his naivety to get away with mischief. But she was always protective of her little brother. Maybe if she was alive, she would have never let him leave. I should have never let him leave.
I clear my mind and take another look around. The East wall windows are boarded up, letting in little light while keeping out the storm. The wood used for it came from the small tables, the unused pieces strewn about. Only two long tables have survived with layers and layers of dust on it. The fireplace long lost its kindling.
This is the place Julian mentioned. But this is not the place Julian described.
“The fireplace is where the heroes are. The monster fighters, the king’s knights, and the mercenaries. The tales forged in this fire are quite hard to believe. But it’s the look on the face of the story tellers that confirms the truth in their voices”
I feel a warmth as if the ghost of the last firewood still lingered. But that is just the trick of my mind. There was no fire. No Julian. The temperature drops in the room. I check the windows. The boards are holding. The cold didn’t come from the outside. It came from within me. The floor starts slipping from under my feet. I hold the bar counter. The world feels heavy. I slowly step towards the nearest stool behind the bar counter. I sit struggling to breathe. One hand grasps the letter tightly, the other holds the bar counter. Neither able to let go. Time stops.
I notice some kegs of ale marked “Golden Liquid” hidden under the bar. The boastful, adventure-loving savages of The Last Hearth seem to have left it behind without a second thought. The way Julian left me.
“I know I don’t write often enough. But I have joined a group of Rangers. We are going North to the Untamed Forest. Not too far, just enough to explore the nearby ruins and see what we find. I know what you would say. It is too dangerous. Not many return. But I am going. They say the war is inevitable and once it breaks out, Heziban will be as dangerous as the Untamed Forest. I am tired of being just a traveling merchant listening to other people’s stories of glory. It is time I earn some glory of my own. I will write once I am back”
The storm has grown tired and starts to die down. I notice the letter has slipped my hand and settled on the counter. I expect to see it littered with tears. Instead I find the tears frozen on my cheek.
Nothing left to do but to fill this void in my heart. I pour myself a glass of Golden Liquid and start reading the letter again
“Dear Mama,…”
An abrupt sound brings me out of my stupor. A silhouette stands in the open door. The door pounds to a close as does my heart. The stranger slowly starts walking towards me while unravelling the garb hiding their face. A wrinkled face fenced by a gray mane reveals the scars of many fights. One in particular has left a deep gash across the left eye. The eye is looking directly at me. A moment passes as the stranger studies me.
“I had heard The Last Hearth had been abandoned”. His accent is unfamiliar, maybe Eastern. I remain silent. He continues. “Guess I heard wrong. I also heard there was still some Golden Liquid available. I see that bit is true”. The calmness in his voice is betrayed by his cloak — grey, torn in many places and hinting at the shapes of hidden weapons. I pour him a drink still unsure of his true intentions. The steadiness in my hand surprises me. I should be scared, I am not. I closely watch him finish his drink, slightly amused at my own calm. As he readies himself to leave, I close my eyes expecting a life ending blow that is never delivered. Just the thud of the door. A pair of coins glint on the counter. Cold, unmoving, as empty as the Hearth!
