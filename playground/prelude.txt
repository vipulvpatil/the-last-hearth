I close the door with my back at it. Slowly, I slump to the floor. I made it… barely. The last few weeks blur past my closed eyes. A pain shoots down my leg, reminding me of the bear attack. While the leg refuses to heal, the salve seems to have fixed what's left of my arm. I instinctively bend my fingers confirming most of me has made it here. Here to the...
The Last Hearth
As I take the hood down and wipe off the flakes of snow from my face, a darkness fades mildly revealing a dimly lit tavern. 
[An image of the tavern fully lit with a few patrons]
Long tables in the middle and a few smaller ones along the windows. All occupied. Large bar at the far end tended by two men. And a fireplace on the West wall. A picture of a woman on the mantle. Wait! There is no picture! There is nothing here! Just an emptiness.
This is how he had described it. I take out the letter from my pocket and start reading it again
“A picture of the woman twice as pretty as Marie and you know how pretty Marie is. Some say she was the daughter of the original owner of the Hearth. Others claim she was the wife of the Lord who built this place. No one knows for sure”.
Julian was always too quick to believe, too trusting of others.
[An image of the tavern dark and broken]
I clear my mind and take another look around. The windows are boarded up, letting in little light while keeping out the storm. The wood used for it came from the small tables, the unused pieces strewn about. Only two long tables have survived with layers and layers of dust on it.
This is definitely the place Julian mentions, but not the one he describes.
“The fireplace is where the heroes are. The monster fighters, the king’s knights, and the mercenaries. The tales forged in this fire are quite hard to believe. But it’s the look on the face of the story tellers that confirms the truth in their voices”
I feel a warmth as if the ghost of the last firewood still lingered. Then the temperature drops. I check the windows. The boards are holding. But the cold continues to spread threatening to engulf me. I hold the bar counter. Fighting the weight of the cold. I slowly step towards the nearest stool behind the bar counter. I sit struggling to breathe. One hand grasps the letter tightly, the other holds the bar counter. Neither able to let go. The cold eventually subsides.
I notice some kegs of ale marked “Golden Liquid” hidden under the bar. Left behind! Same as me.
“I am in the Rangers Guild now. We are going South to the Untamed Lands to explore the nearby ruins and see what we find. The Rangers Guild have never failed to return from their expedition. As a Ranger would say, this is what makes them better than the Scout Band. I am tired of being just a traveling merchant listening to other people’s stories of glory. It is time I earn some of my own.”
The storm has grown tired and starts to die down. I notice the letter has slipped my hand and settled on the counter. I expect to see it littered with tears. Instead I find the tears frozen on my cheek.
I pour myself a glass of Golden Liquid and start reading the letter again
“Dear Mama,…”
An abrupt sound brings me out of my stupor. A silhouette stands in the open door. The door pounds to a close as does my heart. The stranger slowly starts walking towards me while unravelling the garb hiding their face. A wrinkled face fenced by a gray mane reveals the scars of many fights. A moment passes as the stranger studies me. A faint metal clinging accompanies him. It is intentional. I attempt to steady my breathing but fail. 
He reaches the counter and continues to gaze upon me. There is a door behind me but it is too far. The only other exit in the room is behind him. His fingers twitch as he notices the same. This will be quick.
I hear a hissed voice. "A drink for the thirsty". The lips never move. As I grab a goblet from under the counter, I notice the fingers move again. 
I pour him a drink still. The steadiness in my hand surprises me. He finish his drink, but one eye always on me. As the left hand keeps the drink down, the right fingers twitch one last time. I close my eyes expecting a life ending blow that is never delivered. Just the thud of the door. A pair of coins glint on the counter. Cold, unmoving, as empty as the Hearth.



--> Review

This reads like a rough draft—there’s raw atmosphere in it, but it’s weighed down by repetition, uneven pacing, and overexplaining. Some strengths and problems:

Strengths

The cold, exhausted arrival works—the “slumping to the floor” moment sets a weary tone.

The juxtaposition between Julian’s hopeful descriptions of the tavern and the protagonist’s bleak reality is effective. It creates a tension between memory, rumor, and decay.

The arrival of the stranger has good dramatic potential: you managed to build unease with the twitching fingers and the ambiguous voice.

Weaknesses

Overwritten: Nearly every paragraph pushes too hard. “I hold the bar counter. Fighting the weight of the cold. I slowly step towards the nearest stool…” feels stretched where a sharper line would hit harder.

Redundant imagery: Snow, cold, pain, dust, emptiness—all repeated often. The effect dulls instead of intensifies. Pick fewer images and let them land.

Tonally inconsistent: The tavern sometimes feels ghostly, sometimes like a ruin, sometimes like just an abandoned inn. Decide whether it’s eerie, broken, or mystical—right now it’s trying to be all three.

Letter excerpts: They go on too long and drain urgency. They’re more “telling” than showing, and Julian’s voice feels generic. They should reveal character, but instead they read like filler lore.

Stranger scene: It loses impact because it dithers—lots of “he studies me / I try to breathe / I close my eyes / the blow never comes.” The tension is good, but it drags instead of snapping.

Clichés: “Scars of many fights,” “the cold continues to spread threatening to engulf me,” “a life ending blow that is never delivered”—these weaken the mood.

Overall: the skeleton is solid, but it’s buried under too much description and redundancy. If you stripped this to half its length, cutting repetition and clichés, the atmosphere would sharpen dramatically. Right now it feels like you don’t trust the reader to feel the weight unless you keep hammering it in.

Want me to zero in on the letter passages (since they’re the weakest link right now), or the stranger encounter (since that’s your big tonal climax)?
