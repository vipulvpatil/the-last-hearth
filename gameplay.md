# Core Stats
*(0 to 10 scale, hidden from the player)*

## **Compassion** Care for the world as a whole
- **0** = indifferent
- **Higher** = more invested in the greater good

## **Empathy** Care for specific individuals  
- **0** = apathy
- **Higher** = stronger pull toward personal bonds and patrons

## **Self** Care for one's own survival, safety, and comfort
- **0** = selfless disregard for self
- **Higher** = strong instinct to protect oneself above others

---

## Starting Values (Chapter 1)
- **Compassion** = 0 *(indifferent to the larger world)*
- **Empathy** = 5 *(naturally caring for individuals)*
- **Self** = 5 *(not yet fully defined by actions)*

---

## Behavior of the System
- Choices shift one or more stats depending on whether they favor the world, an individual, or self-preservation
- No stat is "good" or "bad". the system is about **tension between values**, not optimization
- Maxing stats has no mechanical reward; outcomes are narrative, not gamified

---

## Contradictions
- Occur when the player makes a choice inconsistent with their current emotional profile *(e.g., a highly empathetic character acting coldly)*
- Contradictions **do not kill** the player but **erode memory control**

---

## Reminiscence Mechanic
- At certain points, the player must recall memories *(past or newly forged)*
- Limited memory slots mean some memories are **forgotten or warped**
- Contradictions reduce control, making it more likely the player will lose or misremember important memories
- **Early chapters** emphasize glimpses into the protagonist's past
- **Later chapters** emphasize retaining newly forged bonds and events

---

## Consequences
- Memory loss manifests **narratively, not mechanically** --- characters forget names, misremember events, or contradict themselves in dialogue
- The world "remembers" the player through **actions, not stats**
- **Tragic erosion of self** is the thematic payoff, not game-over screens
